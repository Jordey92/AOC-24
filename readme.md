# Advent of Code 2024 - My Solutions in Deno ðŸ¦•
This repository contains my solutions for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) using Deno. Each day's solution is implemented in TypeScript and runs using the Deno runtime.

This repository documents my learning process as I tackle each day's challenge, experimenting with various programming approaches along the way.

## Structure

```
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ 1-0.ts    # Day 1 input data
â”œâ”€â”€ 1-1.ts    # Day 1 Part 1 solution
â”œâ”€â”€ 1-2.ts    # Day 1 Part 2 solution
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

## File Naming Convention
- `{day}-0.ts`: Contains the input data for that day's puzzle
- `{day}-1.ts`: Solution for Part 1 of the day's puzzle
- `{day}-2.ts`: Solution for Part 2 of the day's puzzle

## Running Solutions

To run a specific solution:
```bash
deno run {day}-{part}.ts

# Examples:
deno run 1-1.ts  # Run Day 1, Part 1
deno run 1-2.ts  # Run Day 1, Part 2
```
